<h1>Welcome to an Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) Demo</h1>
<img src="aap.png" alt="">

<p>This website was built using Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).  The ansible playbooks that built this first built a Amazon Web Serivces (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), then went on to build a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 machine.  Once the linux machine was on the network ansible playbooks were used to subscribe the machine to the Red Hat customer portal and register the machine with Red Hat Insights, a post install process was run to secure the machine and then Linux, Apache, Mariadb, PHP (LAMP) stack was deployed an is what is making this webpage available to you now!</p>
